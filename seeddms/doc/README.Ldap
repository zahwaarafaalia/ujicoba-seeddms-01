Ldap configuration
===================

The configuration for authentication against an ldap server needs to be done
in the `settings.xml` file using a text editor. It cannot be edited from within the
web gui.

SeedDMS supports ldap authentication using an Active Directory (AD) or a
regular ldap server, e.g. openldap

The location of the ldap server is specified in two parameters: `host` and
`port`.  `host` can be either a plain hostname or an ldap URI, including the
protocol, the host and optionally the port, e.g. ldap://localhost:389. In case
of an URI the port in the configuration must remain empty.

The authentication itself is a two step process which differs, depending on how
to bind to the server. If the configuration sets 'bindDN' and 'bindPW', those
values will be used for a initial non anonymous bind to the ldap server
otherwise an anonymous bind is executed.

After the initial bind, a ldap search for either 'uid=<username>' (ldap) or
'sAMAccountName=<username>' (AD) below basedn is done. The purpose of this
search is to retrieve a working bindDN which is then used to actually
authenticate the user. In case of an anonymous first bind the search will
likely fail and the bindDN for the second bind will be either
'uid=<username>,<basedn>' (ldap) or '<username>@<accountDomainName>' (AD). If
the search succeeds the bindDN will be taken from the user's data in the ldap
server. This bindDN will be used for a second bind using the users password.
If the second bind succeeds the user could be successfully authenticated.

The data from the ldap server can be used to create an account in SeedDMS
if the user trying to login does not exist yet, but was able to authenticate.
This will only be done if 'authentication->restricted' in the configuration
is set to false. In that case the common name (cn) and email address is taken
from ldap. An already existing account in SeedDMS will be updated with data from
ldap.

Since version 5.1.35 and 6.0.28 the field name of the email address in ldap
can be set with the attribute `mailField`. If it is not set it defaults to `mail`.

Since version 5.1.34 and 6.0.27 the groups of a user stored in the ldap directory
can be synchronised with the groups in SeedDMS. The ldap field storing
the groups can be configured with the attribute `mailField`. This will add
new groups in SeedDMS and a—ïsign them to the user.

Examples
---------

Anonymous bind to openldap on localhost, port 389
- type = "ldap"
- baseDN = "ou=users,dc=mycompany,dc=de"
- host = "ldap://localhost"

During authentication as user 'admin' the following steps are executed

1. connect to ldap server at localhost:389
2. do an anonymous bind 
3. search for 'uid=admin' below basedn
4.1. if search succeeds use the dn from the user
4.2. if search fails use 'uid=admin,<basedn>' as dn
5. do a non anonymous bind with dn and password entered by user
6. if step 5. succeeds the use is authenticated

If bindDN and bindPW are specified in the configuration, the second step
will be a non anonymous bind.
